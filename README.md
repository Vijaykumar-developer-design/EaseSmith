# E-commerce Listing Page

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the app: `npm start`

## Approach

- I used a component-based approach for modularity.
- React Router was used for navigation between pages.
- The Add to Cart functionality is handled using a modal.
- Pagination is implemented with mock data.

## Challenges

- Aligning the design closely with Figma.
- Ensuring the modal state and page routing worked seamlessly.
